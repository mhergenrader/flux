    <section id="todoapp"></section> <!-- a thematic section of a page: can be used to divide
    a whole page into sections or even be nested under article to divide that into sections
    
    <article> is for self-contained works that can stand alone or be reused in different context;
      type of section element that can appear on other sites 
    
    sections can have their own internal heading hierarchy, no matter where in the document it is
    (for example, could be under some heading in the original document, but can start its own
    heading hierarchy at h1) - this is because HTML actually sets up an entry in the document
    hierarchy for a new section element (article also) 
    
    footer element you can have within document or within sectioning element like section or
    article; for stuff that usually comes at end of page/section (though no rule of course saying
    that it must go at the end)
    
    both of these are pretty straightforward, but use these rather than just division elements! 
    
    section is a thematic group of content-->
